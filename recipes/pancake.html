        Chef John's Sweet-Savory Cornmeal Mancakes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Sweet/savory hybrids can be tricky sometimes but I think this worked beautifully. We are talking about bacon,
        cheese, and onions after all, so it wasn't that big of a shock. The way the chipotle-spiced maple syrup brought
        everything together was a risk well rewarded.

        <li>½ cup thinly sliced green onions</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup cornmeal</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups milk</li>
        <li>2 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, grated</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup warm maple syrup, or to taste</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon chipotle chile powder, or to taste</li>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until evenly browned,
          about 10 minutes; remove from heat. Stir green onions into bacon and saute in hot fat until slightly softened,
          1 to 2 minutes. Transfer bacon mixture to a strainer to drain, retaining drippings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whisk flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a large bowl. Add
          drained bacon mixture, milk, Cheddar cheese, eggs, melted butter, and sugar to flour mixture; whisk until
          batter is smooth. Let batter rest for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Combine maple syrup and chipotle chile powder together in a small bowl; whisk until chile powder is completely
          dissolved.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat 1 teaspoon bacon drippings, 1 teaspoon oil, and 1 teaspoon butter on a griddle over medium-high heat.
          Drop batter by 1/4-cupful onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes.
          Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. Transfer pancakes
          to plate and top with maple syrup.
