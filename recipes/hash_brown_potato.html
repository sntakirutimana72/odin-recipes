        <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Gather all ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze dry.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the onion, flour, and egg until evenly distributed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is sizzling hot, place
          potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer. Cover the whole bottom of the pan, or make separate piles
          like pancakes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side. It should take at least 5
          minutes per side. If you are cooking them in one big piece, it can be cut into quarters for easier flipping.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve hot and enjoy!
